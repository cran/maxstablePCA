# maxstablePCA

A package for dimensionality reduction of multivariate extremes using the idea of PCA to 
obtain a resonable compact description of the data. 

### Main functionalities

* Transform a dataset to standard margins to use well known ideas from extreme value theory
* Perform a dimensionality reduction of a dataset to a fixed number of encoding variables. For further information about the theory of this consider looking at the references.
* Evaluate the quality of this reconstruction.
* Transform the data back to the distribution of the original dataset.

### Examples on simulated and real world data
